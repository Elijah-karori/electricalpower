To calculate the AC power requirement for an inverter from the power ratings of your electronics, you need to add up the power ratings of all the devices you want to use with the inverter. This will give you the total power requirement in watts. Then, you can convert this value to VA (volt-amps) by dividing it by the power factor (PF) of your devices. The power factor is typically around 0.8 for home appliances².

For example, if you have a total load of 1060 watts and a power factor of 0.8, your AC power requirement would be 1060/0.8 = 1325 VA or 1.325 KVA. In this case, an inverter with a standard rating of 1.5 KVA would be required to carry the load².

Is there anything else I can help you with?
